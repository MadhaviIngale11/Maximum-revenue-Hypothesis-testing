## Introduction
This project focuses on determining whether there is a significant difference in revenue generated by taxi rides based on the mode of payment: cash or card. Through hypothesis testing, we aim to identify which payment method yields higher revenue, providing valuable insights for taxi service providers.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze taxi ride data and perform hypothesis testing to determine whether the mode of payment (cash or card) impacts the revenue generated.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of taxi ride records, including details such as:

Payment method (Cash or Card)
Fare amount
Trip distance
Trip duration
Date and time of the trip
Data Source:Kaggle

## Methodology
Data Cleaning: Remove any null or irrelevant entries to ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of the data and visualize the relationship between revenue and payment methods.
Hypothesis Formulation: Establish null and alternative hypotheses to test the impact of payment methods on revenue.
Statistical Testing: Performed T-test  to evaluate the hypotheses.
Result Interpretation: Analyze the results of the hypothesis tests to draw conclusions.
## Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in the revenue generated by cash and card payments.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in the revenue generated by cash and card payments.
## Results
The hypothesis testing yielded the following statistical results:
T-statistic: 169.2111527245052
P-value: 0.0
Based on these results, we rejected the null hypothesis (H₀), confirming that there is a significant difference in the revenue generated by cash and card payments. The extremely low P-value indicates that the observed difference is statistically significant, meaning the mode of payment has a strong impact on the revenue.
